# NearestNeighbor Classifier

## What is this?
The NearestNeighbor Classifier is a program that helps to classify or categorize new data points by comparing them to known data points. It uses the nearest neighbor approach, which finds the closest match based on distance calculations.

## What it Does
- **Classifies Data:** It assigns categories or labels to new data based on their closest resemblance to existing data points.
- **Adaptable Data Input:** Works with data from files or allows manual data input for flexibility.
- **Determines Orientations:** Useful for identifying the orientation or position of objects, which is crucial in various fields.

## How to Get Started
### What You Need
- A computer with a C++ compiler like GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio.

### How to Set Up
To compile the project, use the following command:
```bash
g++ -o classifier Source.cpp Data.cpp NNClassifier.cpp AnotherClassifier.cpp -I .

**Different Ways to Use This Classifier**
Robotics: In robotics, this classifier can help robots understand their surroundings by classifying objects based on their orientation. For instance, a robot could use it to differentiate between objects lying flat and those standing up.
Healthcare: In medical imaging, it can classify scans or images to identify patterns close to known medical conditions.
Mobile Apps: Apps that need to understand device orientation or movement patterns can use this classifier. For example, an app could determine if a phone is held upright or sideways to adjust the screen orientation accordingly.
**Real-Life Examples**
Automated Sorting Systems: Sorting facilities use classifiers to automatically sort packages based on size and shape by comparing each item to a database of known dimensions.
Security Systems: Security cameras equipped with motion sensors can classify types of movement, such as walking versus running, to detect possible threats more effectively.
Interactive Games: In gaming, a classifier can be used to adjust game control based on the player's physical orientation or gestures, enhancing the interactive experience.
