# NearestNeighbor Classifier

## What is this?
The NearestNeighbor Classifier is a program that helps to classify or categorize new data points by comparing them to known data points. It uses the nearest neighbor approach, which finds the closest match based on distance calculations.

## What it Does
- **Classifies Data:** It assigns categories or labels to new data based on their closest resemblance to existing data points.
- **Adaptable Data Input:** Works with data from files or allows manual data input for flexibility.
- **Determines Orientations:** Useful for identifying the orientation or position of objects, which is crucial in various fields.

## How to Get Started
### What You Need
- A computer with a C++ compiler like GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio.

### How to Set Up
To compile the project, use the following command:
```bash
g++ -o classifier Source.cpp Data.cpp NNClassifier.cpp AnotherClassifier.cpp -I .
